# User Stories 

I am an Alchemy Career Career Track Student who is looking for a job in software development. Cover Letters need to be personal and I struggle with that, so I need a generator that takes in my personal info. 

I have never written a cover letter because my previous career did not require one, so I am looking for a template or cover letter generator.

I suffer from writer's block and need a creative place to start. I write so many cover letters that all must be unique, so I wish there was an app the get me started in my writing process. 

I come from a non-related career background. I have written cover letters for other jobs, but none have related specifically to software engineering. I would like a template that accurately and seamlessly includes my relevant past experience and relates accomplishments from past jobs to the job I’m seeking, even if those industries don’t overlap.
